FONTS
Title tag font must fill its viewport.
But Ubuntu 34-sized font is not _exactly_ 34-sized, but rather 30 ( -2px top, -2 px bottom ). So we chose the 36-sized version.

== MENU ==

Keep the sidebar and the bottom bar.

SIDEBAR
Instead of time and playl pos, show the time.


FONT
Use 18 Ubuntu Light for menu font.


== DESCRIPTION ==

A complete, classy theme mimicking projections, which only shows the important informations while still being pleasant ( thanks to Hayden Pearce anti-aliased fonts ) and easy to read.
I chose bars and colors over icons, which obviously aren't suited to such a tiny screen.
Note: battery is shown with the color of the square on the top right of the main window ( full -> empty == green -> red ; blue == charging ).
